# Heojun-Medicine-Room
### Motivation and Summary
This game was created to honor the achievements of Heo Jun, a UNESCO World Individual in Korea in an engaging way.
The game encapsulates minigames such as using acupuncture to cure the Korean people, collecting medicinal herbs, and a mountain spirit quiz.<br />
My aim in creating this game was to help individuals (especially younger ones) learn more about this important figure.

### Methodology
I used javascript to create the games structure, and drew the characters and objects myself using digital art. I coded for each object and used javascript functions to make each object move on its own. I also created animations using several frames to make the Heo Jun character moved according to the user's commands.

<br />
Here's one segment of code.
<br />
One of the most time consuming aspects of this project was collecting information, creating dialogue and making sure the dialogue was linked to an object. Without this in the code, the game wouldn't move on to the next scene. 
The attached file is an apk file, so can be run on android. One could also search for "Nox App Player" and install the program on a computer.

### Challenges Faced During Development
One challenge I faced during development was debugging the acupuncture game. A problem I encountered were the self-drawn elements not showing up on screen. I soon realized that this was an interface issue, and changed the file format and cropping settings to resolve this issue. I also had to practice debugging javascript code for the first time.

### Next Steps
In the future, I would like to expand the game to incorporate more aspects of history and help illustrate how Heo Jun grew up. I would also like to lengthen the project so it can be published not just on a website.
