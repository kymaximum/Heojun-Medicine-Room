# Heojun-Medicine-Room
### Motivation and Summary
This game was created to honor the achievements of Heo Jun, a UNESCO World Individual in Korea in an engaging way.
The game encapsulates minigames such as using acupuncture to cure the Korean people during the Japanese invasion, collecting medicinal herbs, and a mountain spirit quiz.<br />
My aim in creating this game was to help individuals (especially younger ones) learn more about this important figure and spread Korea's history.

### Methodology
I used javascript to create the games structure, and drew the characters and objects myself using digital art.

Here's one segment of code.

The attached file is an apk file, so can be run on android. One could also search for "Nox App Player" and install the program on a computer.

### Challenges Faced During Development
One challenge I faced during development was debugging the acupuncture game. A problem I encountered were the self-drawn elements not showing up on screen. I soon realized that this was an interface issue, and changed the file format and cropping settings to resolve this issue. I also had to practice debugging javascript code for the first time.

### Next Steps
In the future, I would like to expand the game to incorporate more aspects of history and help illustrate how Heo Jun grew up, not just during the Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592.
